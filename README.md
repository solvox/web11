# Shoutem

Shoutem is a platform for building beautiful React Native mobile apps. The easiest way to understand what Shoutem is to think of it as the WordPress for mobile apps. Apps are divided into smaller modules, called `extensions`. On WordPress you build a website out of plugins; on Shoutem you build a mobile app out of extensions. This architecture helps us achieve big development efficiency.

## Feature requests

## React Native

Shoutem app is a React Native app. We designed extensions’ architecture with the goal not to add overhead over pure React Native. If you know React Native, you will know how to write Shoutem extensions. If you're just starting with React Native, check out our [React Native School](https://school.shoutem.com/).

## Marketplace

Shoutem prepared and open sourced a lot of extensions that you can use in your apps. Don’t reinvent the wheel: reuse extensions which are suitable for you, customize them or create new ones. You can find the full list of extensions [here](https://github.com/shoutem/extensions).

## Customization

All our extensions are open sourced, so you can modify anything you want by simply forking them. You can also write your own ones from scratch.

## Tools and docs

We've prepared tools to speed up your extension development like [Shoutem CLI](https://shoutem.github.io/docs/extensions/reference/cli), [Shoutem UI toolkit](https://shoutem.github.io/ui/) for faster component development and documented all the concepts on this [developer's portal](http://shoutem.github.io/).

If you find some bug or have a suggestion on how to improve anything, feel free to contribute or raise an issue!
