# Screen

Screen is a React Native's `View` with additional background color defined in Theme (defaults to gray).

## API

#### Props

`Screen` has no specific (custom) Props, however, it supports every prop that the standard React Native `View` component supports. For full list of available props, visit

* **paper**: Applies a `Light` color, as defined in Theme

#### Style

* Supports every `Style` prop that the standard React Native `View` component supports
