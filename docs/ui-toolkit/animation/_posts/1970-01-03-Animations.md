# Animation
<hr />

When building an app, there's always a need to create animations to enrich the user experience. Although React Native [provides a way](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html) to implement arbitrary animations, it is not an easy task to do, even for simple animations. That's where `@shoutem/animation` package comes in. The package contains **animation [components](#components)** that should be wrapped around components that you want to animate, and [**drivers**](#driver) that _drive_ the animation components.

## Installation

Simply install it with:

```ShellSession
$ npm install @shoutem/animation
```

## New animations - coming soon

We're working hard to open source more `animation components` and `drivers`, which are already helping us in many [Shoutem extensions]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/getting-started). Some of them are:

**Drivers:**

- `ComputionalDriver`
- `TouchDriver`

<br />
**Animation components:**

- `Slide`
- several `Transitions`

<br />

Stay tuned!
